    "motivations": "A certain period of time has passed since the start of DRep, and I decided to run to convey the voices of delegators that cannot be picked up by the current PR. This policy is to avoid negotiations such as delegation competition with other DRep. Regarding Cardano activities, he has been active as a stake pool operator and has also worked on many projects at Catalyst. Basically, we are working on a project that is sustainable and provides a long-term product that serves as a prototype for Cardano's use cases.\n",
    "objectives": "Regarding development and system design, I support the proposal to follow IOG-led Cardano until 2024. I basically agree with marketing and promotional activities. however,\n\nDRep participation rate is important for Cardanoâ€™s decentralization. However, the resulting lack of decentralization is acceptable and we respect the leadership of IOG and other core companies. However, if a rival team emerges that makes Cardano better, I will not have faith in IOG. I agree with the proposal that is the best way for Cardano to grow.\n",

    "qualifications": "I am an active physical researcher (Ph.D Asst. Professor) with  over 70 academic papers. The most cited papers have more than 500 citations. I was also received numerous academic awards. As a researcher who can be active on the world's front lines, I will do my best to ensure that academic-based Cardano can grow without taking high risks.\n"
